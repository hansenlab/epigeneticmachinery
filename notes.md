- OMIM column makes all the rows high
- Not Cancer / Not Neuro is weird terminology
- PDF button doesn't work for wide tables
- The OMIM number in the OMIM phenotype should be a link
- Perhaps OMIM full summary should be a tool tip
- margins on the left
- column with haploinsufficiency is linked to disease
- JAX information link to mouse models (http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:2682319)
- mode of inheritance column
- Better (longer) column names with spaces
- HAR term - could be acetylation. The R is unnecessary because it is in a reader column
- To conserve some space for is_mdem and tf_acrivity you could just call those columns MDEM and TF and just put X where they are since itâ€™s binary
